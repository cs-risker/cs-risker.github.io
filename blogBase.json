During this process, I took detailed notes on most of the chapters, and these notes can be searched on the blog of my homepage(please search for: CSAPP Reading Notes).\n## 3.Other Useful Tools\nIn addition to the important computer professional knowledge mentioned above, I have also explored a certain range of common tools in the field of computers, and I have discussions on most of them in my blog(for example,you can search for:  GitHub remote branch management).

During the process, I recorded detailed experimental procedures, which can all be found on my blog (please search for: cmu15-213 experiment records on the homepage).
