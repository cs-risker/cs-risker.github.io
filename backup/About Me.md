## 1.Data Structures and Algorithms
I'm familiar with commonly used data structure and algorithm programming ideas, and have recorded the solutions of various classic problems on leetcode, uploading them to my github: [leetcode-notes]()
## 2.Computer Architecture
I have studied the classic textbook "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" from Carnegie Mellon University, also known as "CSAPP". During this process, I took detailed notes on most of the chapters, and these notes can be searched on the blog of my homepage(please search for: cmu15-213 experiment records on the homepage).
## 3.Other Useful Tools
In addition to the important computer professional knowledge mentioned above, I have also explored a certain range of common tools in the field of computers, and I have discussions on most of them in my blog(please search for: ). Below, I have listed a portion of themï¼š
